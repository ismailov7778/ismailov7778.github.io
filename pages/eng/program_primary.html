<h2>IB mission statement</h2>

<p>The International Baccalaureate aims to develop inquiring, knowledgeable and caring young people who help to create a better and more peaceful world through intercultural understanding and respect.
<br>
To this end the organization works with schools, governments and international organizations to develop challenging programmes of international education and rigorous assessment.
<br>
These programmes encourage students across the world to become active, compassionate and lifelong learners who understand that other people, with their differences, can also be right.
</p>
<h2>Primary school Programme</h2>

<p>
The school curriculum is organized around several broad learning outcomes found in the «IB Learner Profile», which reflect closely our core values and beliefs. We believe in a holistic education, with inter-cultural awareness and communication at the forefront.
<br>
The aim of all IB programmes is to develop internationally minded people who, recognizing their common humanity and sharing guardianship of the planet, help to create a better and more peaceful world.
<br>
The most important premise of the PYP is that children learn through their own curiosity — and that it is the school’s responsibility to encourage them to be curious, to ask questions and to explore ways of finding the answers to their questions. This is called «Inquiry Based Learning», and it shapes our entire curriculum.
</p>





<p>The curriculum for Grades 1–5 is based on the International Baccalaureate Primary Years Programme (PYP) and the Kazakhstani Educational Standards and emphasizes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An inquiry approach to learning,</li>
  <li>Rigorous attention to basic skills and content,</li>
  <li>Integration of subjects, where meaningful and productive activity takes place,</li>
  <li>Teaching for creativity, problem solving and conceptual understanding.</li>
</ul>

<p>A full outline of themes, topics and assessment principles is described more fully in the PYP Handbook.</p>
<p>In KG and Grades 1–5 the Kazakhstani Educational Standards & PYP Subjects are as follows:</p>
