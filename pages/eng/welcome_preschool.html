<p>The integrated curriculum of the Pre-school that combines the best experience of national preschool education and the requirements of the International Baccalaureate (IB PYP) program is aimed at learning through research, development of skills and knowledge necessary for the further successful education of children. Classes are conducted in Russian with the learning of Kazakh, also there is an international group. English is an integral part of the curriculum and is learnt by all children.</p>
<p>During the day, children are surrounded by the attention and care of not only highly qualified teachers, but also doctors, speech therapists, psychologists, teachers of other subject disciplines. A five-time meal corresponding to the requirements established in the Republic of Kazakhstan is subject to daily mandatory control of the medical service. In the second half of the day, children from different groups attend together various sports, academic and music groups at the choice of their parents.</p>
<p>The large territory adjacent to the Pre-school is used not only as a playground, but also as a venue for various competitions, contents and events.</p>
<p>Miras Pre-School is continually improving programmes with innovative ways to enhance student fun and learning. Come and see us.</p>
